# Auto Complete - NLP Project

This project demonstrates a basic **Auto-Complete System** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.



## 🚀 What is Happening in This Project?

This notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loads a dataset (likely text-based).
   - Tokenizes and cleans the text.

2. **N-gram Language Modeling**  
   - Uses `nltk` or other libraries to build unigram, bigram, and trigram models.
   - Predicts the next word based on user input using these models.

3. **Auto-complete Prediction**  
   - Takes an input prompt.
   - Returns the most likely next word(s) based on n-gram probabilities.


## 🧠 Libraries Used

- `nltk`
- `re` (regex)
- `collections`
- `pandas`




## 📖 How to Use This Notebook on Google Colab

### 🔗 Step-by-Step

1. **Upload the Notebook to Google Drive:**
   - Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Click on **File > Upload notebook** and select `AUTO_COMPLETE.ipynb`.

2. **Install Required Libraries (if any):**
   If the notebook includes this code block, run it:
   
   !pip install nltk

3. **Run Each Cell:**

Press Shift + Enter to execute a cell.

Make sure you run all the cells in order from top to bottom.

4. **Interact with the Model:**

Input your own text prompt in the input cell.

The notebook will display the predicted next word.


## 📌 Requirements
If you're running locally (instead of Colab), you need:

Python 3.7+

nltk library (install via pip install nltk)
